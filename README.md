Quuve is technically just one application of the Debris Publishing, Inc., ("Debris") framework. Quuve is a financial application, providing portfolio viewing, management, investment research, and backtesting and automated portfolio management ("Rob") capabilities. The code base includes simple feed-forward artificial neural networks and other such technologies.

The code base that is now considered owned by "Debris" has its roots in Python code written beginning in 2001, and was later ported to Squeak in 2007, then to Pharo 0.7 - Many tools were written before parallel solutions were available in Pharo.
